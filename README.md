# Wrapper for [Ag-grid Js Component](https://www.ag-grid.com/)

This add-on wraps the JavaScript component Ag-Grid.

This component reproduces some JAVA API of the Vaadin Grid component to displays tabular data.

It can help if you encounter problems of performance with vaadin-grid if:
* Internet Explorer 11 is a requirement
* You have a lot of columns

This add-on does not bring all the features of ag-grid.

Here is a list of features included:
* Use lazy data source with the DataProvider
* Cell renderers: The cell renderer need to be done in Javascript.
    * It can be done with Polymer, Lit or pure html. It's highly discouraged to use webcomponents inside cell renderer if you want good performance in IE11. 
* Cell Click listener
* Sorting is possible
* Column Grouping
* Frozen column on the left and right
* Dynamic Cell Css class

Here is a list of **not implemented** features:
* Edit cell
* Column reordering
* Filtering
* Row classes
* Selection
* Pivot
